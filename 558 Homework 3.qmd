##Task 1

### Question a:

```{r}

data_a <- read_csv("data.txt")

```

We can't use read_csv() function for reading in this dataset, because the delimiator for that function is flat-file, comma separated or tab separated.The function we can use is read_csv2() because it uses the ";" as the separator which is what we have in our dataset.

```{r}
data <- read_csv2("data.txt")
data
```

### Question b

```{r}
data2 <- read_delim("data2.txt", delim = "6", col_types = "fdc")
data2
```
